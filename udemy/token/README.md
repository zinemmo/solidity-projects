# Supply Chain Contract
This contract is part of an essay from the Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp With Solidity Udemy course.

## Information regarding this piece of code
This contracts was implemented on Remix IDE then imported to a local machine and used Truffle to run. The course uses React.js as a front-end framework and a different Truffle box from what I used. I used Vue.js and the drizzle-vue package, I stopped implementing further changes on this contract as drizzle-vue is no longer supported and has a lot of bugs.

For the course purporse, it is enough development. For my personal learning, this will be developed further on a different project using Web3 and not drizzle, as well as, i'll try to replicate drizzle in a more modern approach.

## How to run this code?
Use the Truffle commands to:

- Enter development mode and create a private chain: `truffle development`;
- Compile the contracts inside the Contracts folder: `truffle compile`;
- Deploy the contracts to the private chain: `truffle migrate`;
